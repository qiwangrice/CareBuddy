    "EHR_record.txt": "Based on the provided EHR record, here is a summary of the patient's medical history and current condition:\n\n**Medical History:**\n\n*   **Age:** 20-year-old male.\n*   **Primary Diagnosis:** Low-grade pancreatic neoplasm (mucinous neoplasm) diagnosed in 2004.\n*   **Treatment:** Underwent a Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) including pancreatectomy and splenectomy in 2004.\n*   **Complications:**\n    *   Secondary pancreatitis following the surgery.\n    *   Bile duct stricture requiring reconstruction in 2008.\n*   **Current Status (Post-Surgery):**\n    *   Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT).\n    *   Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Type 1 Diabetes).\n*   **Past Vaccinations:** Received HIB, Meningovax, Pneumovax, and a flu shot in the fall of 2023.\n*   **Previous Imaging:** Contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis in 2010 showed no tumor recurrence.\n*   **Recent History:** Experienced one episode of abdominal pain in late 2023 (possibly around Christmas). The pain was crampy, located in the lower abdomen, lasted approximately 4 hours, and was not associated with diarrhea, vomiting, melena, or bad diarrhea. The pain has since resolved.\n*   **Current Symptoms:** No ongoing pain, burning, or urinary symptoms. Excellent appetite. No melena or bad diarrhea.\n\n**Current Condition:**\n\nThe patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of a low-grade pancreatic neoplasm treated with a Whipple procedure in 2004. He has significant post-surgical complications, including secondary pancreatitis and a bile duct stricture requiring reconstruction. He is managed with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and insulin for diabetes. He reports a single, resolved episode of crampy lower abdominal pain in late 2023. Currently, he is asymptomatic with an excellent appetite and no concerning symptoms like melena, bad diarrhea, or urinary issues.\n\n**Key Considerations for Comprehensive Evaluation:**\n\n*   **Long-term follow-up:** Given the history of pancreatic cancer and surgery, long-term surveillance is crucial.\n*   **Diabetes management:** Monitoring blood sugar levels is essential due to insulin dependence.\n*   **Pancreatic insufficiency:** Assess the adequacy of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.\n*   **Bile duct stricture:** Monitor for any signs of biliary obstruction or recurrent stricture.\n*   **Secondary pancreatitis:** Assess for any ongoing issues related to pancreatitis.\n*   **Evaluate the recent abdominal pain:** Although resolved, consider potential causes (e.g., post-surgical adhesions, other gastrointestinal issues) during the comprehensive evaluation.\n*   **Screening for recurrence:** Although the 2010 CT was negative, ongoing surveillance strategies should be considered."
